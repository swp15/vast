/// The index consists of multiple partitions. A partition loaded into memory is
/// either *active* or *passive*. An active partition can still receive chunks
/// whereas a passive partition is a sealed entity used only during querying.
/// On startup, it will scan all existing partitions on the filesystem and load
/// the k-most recent partitions into the active set, where k is configurable
/// parameter.
///
/// Arriving chunks get load-balanced across the set of active partitions. If a
/// partition becomes full, it will get evicted and replaced with a new one.
///
/// A query expression always comes with a sink actor receiving the hits. The
/// sink will receive messages in the following order:
///
///   (1) A task representing the progress of the evaluation
///   (2) Optionally a series of hits
///   (3) A DONE atom
///
/// After receiving the DONE atom the sink will not receive any further hits.
/// This sequence applies both to continuous and historical queries.
